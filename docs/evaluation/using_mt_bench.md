# Evaluating Models with MT-Bench

FastChat uses MT-bench, a set of challenging multi-turn open-ended questions, to evaluate models. To automate the evaluation process, strong LLMs like GPT-4 are prompted to act as judges and assess the quality of the models' responses.

For detailed instructions on how to evaluate models using MT-Bench, please refer to the guide at [MT-Bench Evaluation](/docs/evaluation/mt_bench_evaluation.md).
