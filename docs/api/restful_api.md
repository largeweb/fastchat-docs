# OpenAI-Compatible RESTful APIs

FastChat provides OpenAI-compatible RESTful APIs for its supported models, allowing you to use FastChat as a local drop-in replacement for OpenAI APIs. FastChat server is compatible with both openai-python library and cURL commands. A REST API can be executed from Google Colab free tier, as demonstrated in the FastChat_API_GoogleColab.ipynb notebook, available in our repository.

For detailed instructions on using the OpenAI-Compatible RESTful API with FastChat, refer to the [OpenAI API Guide](../api/openai_api.md).
